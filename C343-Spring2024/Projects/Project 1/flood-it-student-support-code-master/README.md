1. The function that roughly fits the graph is f(n) = n^2
2. Based on analysing the code, the time complexity of the flood() function is O(n^2)
3. The analysis does indeed match up with what I am seeing in the graph
4. The data structure I used in my flood() function was a HashSet, along with the given data structures 
   in the parameters such as LinkedList, ArrayList, 2D Array. I believe the time complexity for my flood()
   function is best at the moment, but I can try to improve the function in terms of time complexity in flood1() function
5. The time complexity of my alternative flood function, flood1(), is O(n).
